# PHP_Image_with_title_and_search_example
 Creating mysql database and table for saving uploading images path and titles and validating images size and type at client side in Jquery and back side. Retrieving data and uploading images using AJAX <br>
 <br>
I have created this project as a library for me and that's why the design sucks and I didn't use OOP in this project I know I should have.

<strong> How to use </strong>
<br>
First I recommend to inzip and use this file php_upload_image_create_data_pagination_search_ajax.zip
 <br>
  <br>
1- connect_sr.php : to connect the mysql account  open it add your: <br>
$username= "";  <br>
$password= ""; <br>
$server= ""; // server name<br>
 <br>
2- create_db.php: to create database so run it.<br>
<br>
3- connect_db.php : to connect the database open it and add your: <br>
$username= ""; //mysql account username<br>
$password= ""; // mysql account password<br>
$server= ""; server name<br>
